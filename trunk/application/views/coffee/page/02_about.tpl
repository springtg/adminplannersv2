                    <p>
                        Have you just finished reading a dozen stories to your 
                        child and he still wants more? I know that feeling well. 
                        For those times when you need to get a few chores done,
                        this website is for you (or your children!). I wanted 
                        a site where my children could be read to by an actual 
                        person, with no animation, in as natural a way as possible.
                        I wanted to create the feel that my kids were not just watching
                        another show on a screen (be it an iphone, television, ipad or 
                        computer), but instead, being read to by a real person, holding 
                        a real book, with real pages.
