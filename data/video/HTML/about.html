                	<p>Have you just finished reading a dozen stories to your child and he still wants more? I know that feeling well. For those times when you need to get a few chores done, this website is for you (or your children!). I wanted a site where my children could be read to by an actual person, with no animation, in as natural a way as possible. I wanted to create the feel that my kids were not just watching another show on a screen (be it an iphone, television, ipad or computer), but instead, being read to by a real person, holding a real book, with real pages.</p>

<p>This collection of books are stories that my children have adored over the years, classics from the likes of Pamela Allen and Babette Cole. This site in no way replaces parents reading to their children, which is a precious experience for parent and child alike, but rather, it is another option at those times when something just needs to get done (like boiling pasta on the stove!). Sometimes my children are hard to direct into independent play (being 2 and 4 this is probably typical!) and this site offers an alternative to putting on ANOTHER kids show. Stories are educational and absorbing for children. I hope you like this site as much as my children do!  <span style="font-weight:bold; color:#53bec8; padding-left:5px;"> -  Jasmine Berry</span></p>
